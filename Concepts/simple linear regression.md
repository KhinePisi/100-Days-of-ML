## "Linear" means Line
## Overview
- contains two variables( predictor X and response Y) 
- X is an independent variable and Y is a dependent variable .
- simple because it contains only one  independent variable .
- relationship between predictor input variable and response output variable should be statistically related.
- finds the best fitting line(regression line) equation and makes predictions. <br>

We must clarify the type of relationship between two variables whether they have deterministic realtionship or statistical relationship.<br>
In deterministics relationship, there is an exact equation for the variables. <br>
So, after calculating results by that equation and plotting them on an X-Y coordinate plane, you will get a straight line that all data points falling on directly . <br>
In statistical relationship,
